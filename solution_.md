- ## The above plot shows a positive co-relation between the number of University students and Beer Consumption in Netherlands between 2008 - 2018.
    - Using dataframe.corr() in Pandas to compute pairwise correlation of columns in a dataset returned a Pearson's coefficeint = 0.818.
    
      - A postive Pearson's coefficeint indicates a positive co-relation between the number of University going students and the NL Beer consumption between 2008 - 2018.
      - In otherwords , as the number of University going students increased the Beer consumption in NL also increased. Though it does not show any causality but definetly a co-relation.
